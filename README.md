# MESA Stellar Modeling
This notebook shows how to extract information from a MESA code run. It is detailed and verbose (prints a lot of stuff out). It is based on a tutorial from University of Wisconson Astronomy.

The notebook requires (imports) the mesa_web.py module, which can be downloaded from here. Put that module in the same directory as this notebook file. The mesa_web.py module was provided by the same group who developed MESA-Web, however, there should be no difference in the output from the installed version of MESA vs. MESA-Web.
